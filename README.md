Docker Tutorial:

--Docker: Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of application containers across multiple environments. It is lightweight, portable containers verything needed to run the application.

-- Docker Architecture Components 
1.Docker Client – The interface through which users interact with Docker.
2.Docker Daemon – The background service that manages Docker containers and images.
3.Docker Engine – The core part of Docker that runs and manages containers.
4.Container – A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
5.Image – A read-only template used to create containers.
6.Registry – A centralized place to store and share Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR)
7.Dockerfile – A script used to automate image creation.
8.Docker Compose – A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

-- Containerization Concepts 
1.Namespaces – An isolation mechanism that ensures each container has its own separate environment.
2.Control Groups (cgroups) – A Linux kernel feature used to limit resource usage by containers.
3.Union File Systems (UnionFS) – Layered file system technology used in Docker images.
4.Volumes – A persistent storage mechanism for Docker containers.
5.Networking (Bridge, Host, Overlay) – Different types of Docker networks for container communication.
